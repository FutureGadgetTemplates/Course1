Welcome to Python! In this lesson, we'll explore what Python is and why it's become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It's known for its clean, readable syntax that emphasizes code readability.

```python
# This is Python - clean and readable
print("Hello, World!")
```

Compare this to other languages, and you'll see why Python is often recommended for beginners.

## Why Python?

### 1. Easy to Learn

Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive and close to natural English:

```python
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
else:
    print("You are a minor")
```

### 2. Versatile

Python is used in many fields:

- **Web Development**: Django, Flask, FastAPI
- **Data Science**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn
- **Automation**: Scripts, bots, task automation
- **Game Development**: Pygame

### 3. Large Community

- Extensive documentation
- Thousands of libraries and packages
- Active community support

### 4. In-Demand Skill

Python consistently ranks among the top programming languages for job opportunities.

## Python 2 vs Python 3

Always use **Python 3**. Python 2 reached end-of-life in 2020 and is no longer supported.

When you see code examples online, make sure they're for Python 3. Key differences include:

```python
# Python 3 (use this!)
print("Hello")

# Python 2 (outdated)
print "Hello"
```

## What You'll Build

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:

- Write Python scripts to automate tasks
- Work with files and data
- Create simple programs with user input
- Understand programming fundamentals applicable to any language

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll install Python on your computer and write your first program.

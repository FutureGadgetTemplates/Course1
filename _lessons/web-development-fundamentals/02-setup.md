Before we start coding, let's set up the tools you'll need for web development.

## Installing a Code Editor

We recommend **Visual Studio Code** (VS Code) - it's free, powerful, and widely used.

1. Visit [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2. Download the installer for your operating system
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts

### Recommended Extensions

Once VS Code is installed, add these helpful extensions:

- **Live Server**: Preview your pages with auto-refresh
- **Prettier**: Automatically format your code
- **HTML CSS Support**: Better autocomplete for HTML/CSS

To install extensions:
1. Click the Extensions icon in the sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`)
2. Search for the extension name
3. Click "Install"

## Creating Your First Project

Let's create a folder for your web projects:

1. Create a new folder called `web-projects` on your computer
2. Inside it, create a folder called `my-first-site`
3. Open VS Code
4. Go to File → Open Folder and select `my-first-site`

## Your First HTML File

Create a new file called `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first web page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Viewing Your Page

There are two ways to view your page:

### Option 1: Open directly
- Find `index.html` in your file explorer
- Double-click to open it in your browser

### Option 2: Live Server (Recommended)
- Right-click on `index.html` in VS Code
- Select "Open with Live Server"
- Your page will open and auto-refresh when you make changes

Congratulations! You've set up your development environment and created your first web page.

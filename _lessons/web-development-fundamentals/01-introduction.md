Welcome to web development! In this lesson, we'll explore what web development is and why it's such a valuable skill to learn.

## What is Web Development?

Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites. It encompasses everything from creating simple static pages to complex web applications.

Web development is typically divided into two main areas:

- **Frontend Development**: What users see and interact with (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Backend Development**: Server-side logic and databases

In this course, we'll focus on frontend development.

## Why Learn Web Development?

1. **High Demand**: Web developers are in high demand across all industries
2. **Creative Expression**: Build anything you can imagine
3. **Low Barrier to Entry**: All you need is a text editor and a browser
4. **Immediate Feedback**: See your changes instantly

## How Websites Work

When you visit a website, here's what happens:

1. You type a URL in your browser
2. Your browser sends a request to a server
3. The server sends back HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
4. Your browser renders these files into the page you see

```
Browser → Request → Server
Browser ← Response ← Server
```

## What You'll Need

To follow along with this course, you'll need:

- A **text editor** (VS Code is recommended)
- A **web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge)
- **Curiosity** and willingness to experiment!

In the next lesson, we'll set up your development environment.
